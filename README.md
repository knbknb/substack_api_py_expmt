# Experiments with `substack_api` python module

- Installed [substack_api](https://pypi.org/project/substack-api/) by nhagar from pypi.org as v0.1.0 (released 01/2024)
- A single Jupyter notebook is included in the `notebooks` directory, which only follows along the module's README documentation.
- Just played around with the module's basic functionalities to see what it can do.

Substack does not offer a public API or webhooks for developers to access or integrate its services programmatically. So this is all very hacky and may break at any time.
